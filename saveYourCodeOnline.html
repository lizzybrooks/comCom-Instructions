    <h1>Creating a GitHub Repository for Node Projects</h1>
    <h2>Git is a version control system that allows you to save changes to your code without losing previous drafts. Github is an online storage place for code that uses the git system. Using this system, you can work on a project and keep track of your changes. It takes a minute to set up, but it's worth it. </h2>

                <h2>Initialize your project</h2>
                <p>Open Terminal (mac) or the command prompt (windows). Navigate to your project's root directory (if you open your terminal through VSCode, you'll already be in your project's root directory). Type the following command (or copy and paste it) to initialize the git process inside this project </p>

                <h2>Create .gitignore file</h2>
                <p> A .gitignore file is literally a file that tells the git process which files in your project it should ignore, or not upload to Github. We want to ignore the node files because they're huge and there are too many of them to store online, and also because it's redundant to store them online. Anyone who wants to open the project will use your package.json file to install these additional libraries (called dependencies) on their own computer.</p> 
                <br>
                <p> In VSCode, create a new file, call it .gitignore and put the below text into it. Then save it. </p>
